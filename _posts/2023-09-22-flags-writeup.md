It is not hard to understand that the flags in the image represents letters, and we know the
first 7, which is `PICOCTF`.

After playing around for a while, I could not figure out what these flags means, so I resort
to searching online. And turns out these flags are `International maritime signal flags`. You can
find the reference here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags

Flag: `picoCTF{F1AG5AND5TUFF}`

To be honest pretty cool challenge, but probably have no practical use :)
